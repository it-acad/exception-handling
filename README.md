# Practical Java Course

## To-Do List Project

### Unit Testing and Logging

### üìã Task Overview

### 1. **Develop and Implement Tests:**
- Create a **test layer** for all controllers in the project.
- Implement **unit tests** for the controller layer to verify its functionality.
- Use **JUnit 5** for writing the tests.

### 2. **Add Logging:**
- Implement **logging** in all controllers within the project to track actions and potential errors during runtime.

### 3. **Final Submission:**
- Upload your project to a **GitHub repository**.
- Record a **short video** (2-5 minutes) demonstrating the implemented functionality (controller testing and logging).

## üìå Notes
- Make sure to provide **links** to the GitHub repository and the video as the final deliverables.
- Add detailed logs to capture the flow of controller actions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- **JUnit 5** for implementing the tests.
- A **logging framework** (e.g., SLF4J, Logback) for adding logging to controllers.
